				<b>It Is My Fault</b>
				<br>
					A man in a hot air balloon realizes he is lost. He reduces latitude and
					spots a woman below. He descends a bit more and shouts, “Excuse me,
					can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I
									don’t know where I am.” The woman below replies, “You are in a hot air
									balloon at approximately 30 feet above the ground. You are between 40
									and 41 degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west
									longitude.”<br>
									“You must be an engineer,” said the balloonist. “I am,” replied the
									woman. “How did you know?” “Well,” answered the balloonist.
									“everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to
									make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly, you’ve
									not been much help so far.”<br>
									The woman below responded, “You must be in management.” “I am,”
									replied the balloonist, “but how did you know?” “well.” Said the woman,
									“you don’t know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to
									where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise
									which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you
									to solve your problems. The fact is you are in exactly the same position
									you were in before we met, but now, somehow, It’s My Fault.”

													    <br>
									Men of genius are admired. Men of wealth are envied. Men of power are feared, but only
									men of character are trusted.
														<br>
									The trick is being able to get outside yourself and work from
									outside and watch yourself as an observer.
